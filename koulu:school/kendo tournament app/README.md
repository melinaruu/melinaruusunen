This is a project we did as a group for the university's "software engineering project 1" course. I worked as the team's UI/UX designer and did a lot of work for the frontend. During this project I learned a lot about full stack development and built skills in React and Typescript.

I am continuing this project on the project 2 course as the team's project manager.
